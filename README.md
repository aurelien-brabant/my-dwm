# abrabant's DWM

This is my fork of the Dynamic Window Manager by suckless.

## Added

- status bar alpha ([dwm-alpha](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/))
- window gaps, including bar ([dwm-fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/))
- colorscheme replicating doom emacs theme (although I'm using vim)
- status bar padding
- customized tags, information display on the topbar

## Install

I didn't design this fork to be used by anyone else than myself, but executing
the `install.sh` script is the only thing needed to install it. This scriptes takes
care of everything, including the `.desktop` file required by any window
manager to launch dwm.
